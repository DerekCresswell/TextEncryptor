This encryptor / decryptor takes a string and a password or key to encrypt / decrypt that string.

It was written in Processing 3.5.3

Download Processing and export the files or use the Zip in the most current release version to have an application.

# Purpose
I created this repository as my introduction to GitHub. To get familiar with the the layout, commits, branches, etc.
This was also a good opportunity to make a GUI with ControlP5 and get some familiarity with using libraries in Processing.
